## Getting started üöÄ

### Adding a brick üß±Ô∏è

To add a brick, you have a few options:

\`\`\`sh
# üéØ Activate Mason CLI (if not done already):

dart pub global activate mason_cli
\`\`\`
\`\`\`sh
# Add a brick from a Git URL:

mason add <BRICK_NAME> --git-url https://github.com/shyamexe/bricks-cli --git-path path/to/<BRICK_NAME>
\`\`\`
\`\`\`sh
# Add a brick globally from a Git URL:

mason add -g <BRICK_NAME> --git-url https://github.com/shyamexe/bricks-cli --git-path path/to/<BRICK_NAME>
\`\`\`
\`\`\`sh
# For instance, to add the flutter-package brick:

mason add -g flutter-template --git-url https://github.com/shyamexe/bricks --git-path flutter-template
\`\`\`

## Installation

Add this to your\`pubspec.yaml\` file:

\`\`\`yaml
dependencies:
  scrollable_tab_view: <latest-version>
\`\`\`

## Installation

Import the package in your Dart file:

\`\`\`yaml
import 'package:scrollable_tab_view/scrollable_tab_view.dart';

\`\`\`

## Usage

The ScrollableTab widget allows you to create a tab bar with scrollable tabs without using a controller.

\`\`\`dart
ScrollableTab(
  labelColor: Colors.black,
  tabs: List.generate(
      5,
      (index) => Tab(
            text: 'index $index',
          )),
  children: List.generate(
      5,
      (index) => ListTile(
            title: Center(
              child: Text(
                'tab Number $index',
                style: Theme.of(context)
                    .textTheme
                    .labelLarge!
                    .copyWith(fontSize: 20.0 + (30 * index)),
              ),
            ),
          )),
),

\`\`\`

The ScrollableTabBar and ScrollableTabViewWithController widgets allow you to create a tab bar with scrollable tabs using a TabController.

\`\`\`dart
Column(
  children: [

    ScrollableTabBar(
      labelColor: Colors.black,
      controller: controller,
      tabs: List.generate(
          5,
          (index) => Tab(
                text: 'index $index',
              )),
    ),
    ScrollableTabViewWithController(
      controller: controller,
      children: List.generate(
          5,
          (index) => ListTile(
                title: Center(
                  child: Text(
                    'tab Number $index',
                    style: Theme.of(context)
                        .textTheme
                        .labelLarge!
                        .copyWith(fontSize: 20.0 + (30 * index)),
                  ),
                ),
              )),
    )
  ],
